-  Outlines what the course is
## [What to focus on](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/a6f8ef54)
- Build a general picture of the network infrastructure.
- Be aware of the limitations of the physical network.
- Understand that protocols are systems of rules.
- Learn that IP enables communication between devices.
## [AWS Cloud9](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/fe5b1fbe)
- The argument for AWS at this part of the course & how to install it. (nothing to learn)
## [What is the internet?](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/268243e5)
- A network of networks.
- A network: 2 or more devices connected in such a way that they can communicate or exchange data.
  - At its most basic this is 2 computers connected by a LAN cable.
  - At its most complex it is the whole internet 
- Local Area Network (LAN): A bunch of computers physically near to each other connected by network cables. An office for instance.

- Your home network is the same, probably with a wireless hub or switch. This is a WLAN.
- The hub or switch is the "local" in LAN.

### Inter-network communication:

- Routers are network devices that can route network traffic to other networks. For a LAN they are the gatekeepers in and out.

### A network of networks:

- The intenet is many sub-networks (like your home) connected by routers:

## [Protocols](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/a53e65ce)

- The internet is made by many different devices and different softwares. So in order for them to communicate there are rules that govern the way they send and receive messages. These are protocols.
- "A set of rules that govern the exchange or transmission of information."
- There are many protocols. 
- Why?
  - To address different aspects of network communication. (Structure)
  - To address the same aspect of network communication, but for a different use case. (message transfer rules).
- Different aspects of communication could be:
  -  The structure of the message
  -  The order in which messages are sent and received
- Different protocols for the same aspect:
  - speaking to the teacher in a class
  - speaking to a friend in a social setting.
  - To address the same aspect of network communication, but for a different use case.
- TCP and UDP are examples of 2 protocols that control the same aspect of communication differently.

## [A layered system](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/21ef33af)

- Protocols are best grouped together by the aspect of communication they deal with.
- Rather than trying to understand all aspects of communication simultaneously (language, physics, biology, etiquette) there are models for message thransfer that aim to deal with everything in a manageable way. The two main ways are :
  - The Internet Protocol Suite
  - The OSI model.
<p align="center">
<img width="738" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-07 at 15 18 37" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78854926/230624307-5728f0a0-946b-43dd-bac2-2ae6c425f17f.png">
</p>

- The Internet protocol suite divides layers by **scope of communication**
  - Within a Local network
  - between networks
  - etc. 
- The OSI model divides layers by **the function that each layer supplies**
  - Physical addressing
  - logical addressing and routing
  - encryption
  - compression 
 - Both models have their advantages, but no model will perfectly fit real-world implementation.
### Data encapsulation
- A concept used by most network communication models.
- Hiding data from one layer by hiding it within a data-unit of the level below.

### Protocol Data Units
- A block of data transferred over a network.
- Different protocols and different layers within a protocol refer to PDUs by different names. 

| Layer | Name for PDU
| :---: | :---: |
|link/data layer|'frame'
|Internet/Network 'layer|packet'
|Transport layer|'datagram' or 'segment'

- Despite the different names PDUs always consist of a header, a data payload and in some cases a trailer/footer.
- **The header** provides protocal specific meta-data about the PDU.
  - For example an IP packet header would include fields for the Source IP address and the Destination IP address, which would be used to correctly route the packet.
- **The Data Payload** Is the data we want to transfer.
- The entire PDU from a protocol at one layer is set as the data payload for a protocol at the layer below
  - For example a HTTP request at the Application Layer could be set as the payload for a TCP segment at the Transport layer.

</p>
- The major benefit of this approach is the seperation it creates between the different layers of the protocol. So each layer needn't know anything about how a protocol at another layer is implemented in order to interact. It does its little job, without worrying about what is happening at the other levels.
- Lower levels do a task for the level above them.
- Sandy's image: a slice of ham on floor 5 gets thrown down to floor 4, they put it between slices of bread, throw it down to level 3, they wrap it in cling-film, throw it down to floor 2, they put it in a box, throw it down to floor 1, they put it in a car and drive away.
- The seperation of layers provides a level of abstraction which allows us to use different protocols at one layer without worryinbg about the other layers.
  - A good example of this is at the Application layer where many different protocols are used depending on the application and use case.
## [The physical network](https://launchschool.com/lessons/4af196b9/assignments/097d7577)
- Everything described above is conceptual abstractions, but when you drill down there is a physical reality to the internet, which is the subject of this chapter.
- These are devices, cables, wires, radio-waves, light-waves, etc. bound by the laws of physics.
- These elements are bound by such questions as 'how fast can an electrical signal travel? How far can a radio-wave reach?
### Bits and Signals
- The OSI model defines its base layer as 'physical', but the IP suite doesn't directly relate to it (although there are some physical interactions in the link layer)
- Either way these interactions are concerned with 'bits' ie binary data.
- For transportation these bits are converted into signals.
### Characteristics of a physical network.
- Latency: The time it takes for data to get from one point to another in a network.
  - If a car drives at 50mph down a 10 mile road, then the road has a letency of 12 minutes.  
- Bandwidth: The amount of data that can be sent in a unit of time (probably a second).
  - Adding more lanes to the road increases bandwidth because the road can deliver more cars, but it doesn not affect latency because the cars are still constricted by their maximum speed.
  - Increasing Bandwidth doesn't necessarily improve a network's performance.
- Latency is actually a collection of different types of delay. Here are the elements of latency:
  - Propagation delay: The amount of time it takes for a message to get from sender to receiver. 
    - Speed = distance/time
  - Transmission delay: The route taken by the data will involve many didferent wires, cables, switches, routers etc. The time it takes to get onto the next part of the route adds up and makes the transmission delay. In the analogy of the road, this can be thought of as time spent at roundabouts and interchanges.
  - Processing delay: Data travelling across the physical network doesn't skip unimpeded from one stage to the next. It is processed in various ways. THese processes take time and add up to the processing delay. In the road analoguy this might be checkpoints along the route, or toll-booths.
  - Queueing delay: Networks can only handle so much data transfer. If the amount of traffic exceeds this then the network queues or buffers the data. This can be visualised as time spent in traffic waiting for the toll-booth/checkpoint.
  - Total latency is the combined milliseconds (ms) of the above.
- Other Latency-related terms:
  -  Last-mile latency: Most of hte delays often occur right at the end of the transfer. So entering the LAN. For this reason they are referred to thusly.
  -  Round-trip-time(RTT): Lenght of time for a signal to be sent + for an acknowledgement/response to be received.
### Network Hops
- `traceroute google.com` traceroute is a utility for displaying the route and latency of a path across a network. Running this command returns a list of the hops taken for the test data to get from your device to the google server. The values printed here are the RTT for each hop
### Bandwidth
- Varies across the network. So, not a constant from start to end.
- The capacity of the core network is much greater than the part that connects to your LAN.
- Where the bandwidth goes from relatively high to relatively low a bottleneck can occur.
- Low-bandwidth can be an issue when dealing with large volumes of data.
- However in many situations latency can be a greater impingement on the performance of a networked application.
### Limitations of physical networks
- As developers we cannot really change the physical reality of the network, but understanding how it works will be useful in designing programs that can make best use of the physicial network.
