# [The Transport Layer](https://launchschool.com/lessons/2a6c7439/home)

- This layer deals with how networked applications communicate with each other:
  - how transport layer protocols enable communication between processes (?!)
  - Network reliability is engineered. Peel back the abstraction of the internet to reveal tangible processes that result in the internet we take for granted.
  - Understand the trade-offs (particularly between TCP and UDP).

## [Communication between processes](https://launchschool.com/lessons/2a6c7439/assignments/41113e98)

- The Internet PRotocol provides the inter-network communicationservaces necessary for "minimum viable internet".
- But to create networked applications we need more than IP.
  - A direct connection between applications
  - Reliable network communication.
- The IPs system of addressing is designed to provide communication between *hosts*. These hosts can be on the same network or on the other side of the world. IP is great for getting a message from A to B, but not more than that.
